## Business Problem

Utilities face a fundamental capital allocation problem: unfunded infrastructure risk
far exceeds available maintenance and investment budgets. The CPUC's Risk-Based
Decision-Making (RBDM) framework requires utilities to justify investment decisions
with quantified benefit-cost analyses — but most tools handle risk scoring and
capital optimization separately.

This engine answers three questions simultaneously:

1. Which investments deliver the highest risk reduction per dollar spent?
2. What is the optimal portfolio given a constrained capital budget?
3. How robust are these decisions under uncertainty in cost and benefit estimates?

---

## Financial Impact

On a simulated portfolio of 100 grid investment projects totalling $580M+ in
required capital, the optimization engine identifies a $50M portfolio that delivers
**$180M+ in risk reduction** — a BCR of **3.5x** — compared to $42M in risk
reduction from the regulatory-minimum portfolio at the same budget.

## Methodology

### Expected Value Framework
```
Expected Risk ($)        = P(Failure) × Consequence Cost ($)
Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) = Total Benefits ($) ÷ Project Cost ($)
Net Present Value (NPV)  = Σ [Annual Benefit ÷ (1 + r)ᵗ] − Cost
Risk per Dollar          = Risk Reduction ($) ÷ Project Cost ($)
```

### Portfolio Optimization
Greedy knapsack algorithm maximizing risk reduction per dollar within budget constraint,
with option to force-include regulatory-required projects. Three optimization objectives:
- Maximize risk reduction
- Maximize BCR
- Maximize customers protected

### Monte Carlo Uncertainty Analysis
2,000-simulation Monte Carlo with ±15% BCR noise and ±18% risk reduction noise,
producing P10–P90 confidence intervals and probability of positive BCR.

## Methodological Note

This project applies the same expected-value optimization framework used in
global health economics (GiveWell, USAID cost-effectiveness analyses) to utility
infrastructure investment decisions. The mathematical structure is identical:
identify the intervention that produces the greatest risk reduction per dollar,
subject to a budget constraint, accounting for uncertainty in both costs and outcomes.

This connection — between development economics methodology and utility asset
management — reflects the author's background in both fields.
